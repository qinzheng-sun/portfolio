            <span class="A_02">Hello again!</span>
            <span class="A_03">As a recent graduate from UofT, I have always been fascinated with the combination of art and technology. This passion has led me to pursue coding based and kinetic sculptures. I find it incredibly exciting to be able to create works of art that are not only visually appealing but also interactive. The idea of bringing motion and light to my sculptures is what truly sets them apart and makes them unique.<br>

            <br>Working with coding and kinetics requires a blend of technical and creative skills. As a new media student, I was exposed to various programming languages, such as Javascript and C language, that are essential to creating these works of art. With my technical background, I have been able to experiment and push the limits of what is possible with technology and art. I have also had the opportunity to work with various materials, including acrylics, plastics, wood, and more which has allowed me to bring my ideas to life in new and innovative ways.</span>
